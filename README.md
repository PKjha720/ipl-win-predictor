Selection of teams and match location from dropdown menus.
Real-time prediction of win probability.
Deployed on a free platform for easy access.
Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language used.
Streamlit: For creating the web application interface.
scikit-learn: For the machine learning model.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Pickle: To save and load the trained machine learning model.
Deployment:
The application is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, making it easily accessible to anyone with the link.
